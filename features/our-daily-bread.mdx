dailyScrollCompleted    // Scroll completion state
dailyQuizCompleted      // Quiz completion state
```

```typescript Daily Reset Logic
const today = new Date().toDateString();
const storedDate = localStorage.getItem('dailyBreadDate');

if (storedDate !== today) {
  // New day detected - reset completion states
  localStorage.setItem('dailyBreadDate', today);

}
```
